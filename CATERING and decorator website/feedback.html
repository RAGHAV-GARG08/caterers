<p>Owners runs a first class operation just like his name says. He is wonderful with responding to emails questions and following up with concerns. His staff was very nice and helpful during our rehearsal dinner especially the bartender her hired. Food was tasty and all our wedding party enjoyed the Italian options.
It was wonderful to work with a company that really cares about their business.

<p>I hosted a VIP Broker event at my company’s new model home complex last night and I am so thankful I was referred to use First Class Catering. Michael and his team were a pleasure to work with and the whole process was a breeze. They took care of all the details so I didn’t have to worry about anything during the event. Then there was the food… it was DELICIOUS and beautifully presented. I will definitely refer First Class Catering to my colleagues and I will absolutely be calling them again for any future events. Cheers!</p>

<p>I celebrated my husband’s 55th Birthday & Retirement and contacted First Class Catering Service. Michael Alcantar & his son did an outstanding job with every food tray I ordered: Carnitas, Steak Fajitas, Beef & Chicken Enchiladas, beans & rice; all were delicious! Plus all the fixings were perfect. The presentation of food was so on point. All my guest were surprised how delicious the food was…they loved it. Michael is a professional. He’s very courteous and his customer service skills are class A, just like his catering service! Once again, thank you so much Michael for all of your hard work.

<p>AAAAAAmazing! That’s the best way to put it. From price, to food, to how the wedding day went, Simply Catering was just amazing. Nicole was the coordinator for my actual wedding day and it went on without a hitch. Everybody raved about the food. It was exactly what I pictured when I thought of my wedding day caterer. Thank you so much for everything, Simply Catering!! My husband has 4 more brothers and sisters who will eventually be getting married and we’ll definitely we recommending you to them when the time comes!! Thanks again!</p>

<p>They did a wonderful job at my wedding. My family and I were very picky about the quality and kind of food that we wanted served at the wedding, but Jet was soo receptive to what we wanted and delivered! The food was fantastic and everyone was very professional for a GREAT price.</p>

<p>Everything was perfect on our wedding day. The caterers worked throughout the night preparing our food because the food truck was late because of bad weather in our area, and we never even knew about this issue. (Found out later). Not only was everyone professional, and understanding, but the food was amazing!!! They listened to our requests and even made some new items that we wanted to have at our event. Everyone I have talked to that was at our wedding (350+ guests) have told me how delicious everything was. I especially loved the brisket, bacon wrapped Brussels sprouts, and the corn casserole. We cannot thank Simply Catering enough for making our wedding perfect!
